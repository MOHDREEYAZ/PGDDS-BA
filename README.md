Background: Business Understanding
In recent times, the number of fraud transactions has increased drastically due to which credit card companies are facing a lot of challenges. For many banks, retaining high profitable customers is the most important business goal. Banking fraud, however, poses a significant threat to this goal. In terms of substantial financial loss, trust, and credibility, banking fraud is a concerning issue for both banks and customers alike. With the rise in digital payment channels, the number of fraudulent transactions is also increasing as fraudsters are finding new and different ways to commit such crimes.

 

Now, let’s watch the upcoming video as Thejasvee sheds light on fraud analytics, some common types of fraud happening across different industries and the different ways in which you can deal with it using machine learning.

As you learnt in the video above, credit card fraud is an inclusive term for fraud that is committed using a payment card, such as a credit card or a debit card, by stealing the card information through skimmers. The Federal Trade Commission (US) has estimated that around 10 million people become victims of credit card theft each year. Credit card companies lose close to $50 billion per year to fraud.

 

Finex is a leading financial service provider based out of Florida, US. It offers a wide range of products and business services to customers through different channels, ranging from in-person banking and ATMs to online banking. Over the last few years, Finex has observed that a significantly large number of unauthorised transactions are being made, due to which the bank has been facing a huge revenue and profitability crisis. Many customers have been complaining about unauthorised transactions being made through their credit/debit cards. It has been reported that fraudsters use stolen/lost cards and hack private systems to access the personal and sensitive data of many cardholders. They also indulge in ATM skimming at various POS terminals such as gas stations, shopping malls, and ATMs that do not send alerts or do not have OTP systems through banks. Such fraudulent activities have been reported to happen during non-peak and odd hours of the day leaving no room for suspicion.

 

In most cases, customers get to know of such unauthorised transactions happening through their cards quite late as they are unaware of such ongoing credit card frauds or they do not monitor their bank account activities closely. This has led to late complaint registration with Finex and by the time the case is flagged fraudulent, the bank incurs heavy losses and ends up paying the lost amount to the cardholders.

 

Now, Finex is also not really equipped with the latest financial technologies, and it is becoming difficult for the bank to track these data breaches on time to prevent further losses. The Branch Manager is worried about the ongoing situation and wants to identify the possible root causes and action areas to come up with a long-term solution that would help the bank generate high revenue with minimal losses.

Apprehending fraudsters is outside the scope of banking operations. So, the problem that we need to solve is to not stop the fraudsters but to identify and stop the fraudulent transactions that they are making. Several government entities are involved in trying to prevent or stop this crime.

 

For this, you would need to conduct the root cause analysis with the bank’s PoC to understand the processes/structures that are already in place to deal with anomalous transactions. As you already know, the number of fraudulent transactions is rising day by day, and no proper action is being taken when an unauthorised transaction is made. So, this is where you start your analysis.
